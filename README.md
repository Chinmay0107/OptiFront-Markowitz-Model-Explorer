# OptiFront-Markowitz-Model-Explorer
Model to optimize investment portfolios, enabling users to visualize efficient frontiers and identify optimal asset allocations based on risk and return profiles

Overview
This project implements the Markowitz model, also known as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), which provides a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets to maximize expected return for a given level of risk. The model emphasizes the benefits of diversification and introduces the concept of the efficient frontier.

Features
Calculation of expected portfolio return
Calculation of portfolio risk (variance and standard deviation)
Optimization of asset weights to achieve the best risk-return trade-off
Visualization of the efficient frontier
Support for importing asset return data from CSV files
Customizable parameters for risk-free rate and asset constraints
